{"status":"cached","result":{"verdict":{"verdict":"False","confidence":0.99,"explanation":"The claim that the Earth is flat is demonstrably false. There is overwhelming scientific evidence, accumulated through centuries of observation and experimentation, that confirms the Earth is an oblate spheroid (a sphere that is slightly flattened at its poles and bulging at the equator). This evidence includes satellite imagery, GPS technology, observations of ships disappearing hull first over the horizon, variations in gravity at different points on Earth, lunar eclipses where the Earth's round shadow is cast on the Moon, and circumnavigation of the globe. The sources provided, while describing the flat Earth theory, do not offer credible evidence to support it and are based on pseudoscience and conspiracy theories.","keyEvidence":["The theory claims that there is no such thing as Planet Earth. There are variations of the theory but the most well-known version is quite constant: We live on a flat circular world with some form of dome overhead.","Imagine a disc, like a giant dinner plate. In the middle is the North Pole. All the continents spread outward from there. Surrounding the edges of the plate is Antarctica — but it’s not just a continent at the “bottom.” It’s a massive ice wall that holds in the oceans and keeps everything in place.","Above us, there’s a dome — think of it like a giant glass ceiling or a solid barrier. This is the firmament mentioned in ancient texts."]},"analysis":{"credibilityScore":10,"credibilityReasoning":"The sources provided are from websites promoting the flat Earth theory.
